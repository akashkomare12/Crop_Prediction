# Crop Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the most suitable crop based on environmental factors using a machine learning model trained on a Kaggle dataset.

## Features
- Predict crop suitability based on soil, climate, and other parameters.
- Trained on Kaggle and saved as `.h5` model.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Dataset Link : (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aman2000jaiswal/agriculture-crop-images)](Code Link : (https://www.kaggle.com/code/akashkomare/crop-prediction/edit)))
